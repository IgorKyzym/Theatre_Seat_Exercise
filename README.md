# Theatre_Seating_Task
Learning basics of Collections, Comparable and Comparator.


Create a simple program for theatre seating with following capabilities:
1. Theatre can be of a different size:
    - different number of rows;
    - different number of seats per row;
    - seats must be numbered (example: B12 (row B, seat 12).
2. There must be methods to reserve a seat, as well as to cancel a reservation.
3. Ticket pricing must be based on seat location (for example back row and side seats tickets are cheaper);
4. There must be an option to sort seats by price.
